ABSTRACT
-
Hi!!! ;)
This TodoList is a little project made to learn and experiment with JavaScript and Node.js
It was suggested by 4tomik, and I resolved to replan his architecture and implement any way to get a local server with Node.js inside the app's repository.

The main reason why I included these changes was to go in depth a little more in these technologies to expand the knowledge offered by 4tomik. To do this, I focused on points that, in my opinion, could be improved to have a clearer code and to get an easier run for anyone that wants to clone or download this project to try it.

I used the MVC pattern as the basis to restructure the software architecture, because the structure suggested by 4tomik employs a similar one, but without controller file. 

To facilitate running the local host, I used Express, framework of Node.js, to make a little file that allows to create a localhost to show the app on port 3000.
